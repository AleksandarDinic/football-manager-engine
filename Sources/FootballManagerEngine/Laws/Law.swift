/// The Laws of the Game are the codified rules of association football. The laws mention the
/// number of players a team should have, the game length, the size of the field and ball, the
/// type and nature of fouls that referees may penalise, the frequently misinterpreted offside
/// law, and many other laws that define the sport. During a match, it is the task of the
/// referee to interpret and enforce the Laws of the Game.
